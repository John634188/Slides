# Slides


This code defines a CSS slideshow with image slides and navigation buttons. It creates a responsive slideshow with
a maximum width of 1000 pixels, positioned in the center of the page. The images within the slideshow are initially hidden.
The slideshow is implemented using a series of <div> elements with the class "mySlides". Each <div> represents a slide and 
contains an image and a number indicating the slide's position. The images are specified with the src attribute.
The navigation buttons are represented by <a> elements with the classes "prev" and "next". These buttons allow the user to 
navigate to the previous or next slide when clicked. They are positioned on the top half of the slideshow container.
Below the slideshow container, there are dots or indicators represented by <span> elements with the class "dot". Each
dot corresponds to a slide and allows the user to navigate directly to a specific slide when clicked.`
The JavaScript section of the code defines several functions for controlling the slideshow. The plusSlides(n)
function is used to move the slideshow forward or backward by a specified number of slides. The currentSlide(n)
function is used to display a specific slide indicated by the given number. The showSlides(n) function is responsible
for showing the appropriate slide and updating the active state of the navigation dots. It iterates through the slides
and dots, hiding or showing them based on the value of slideIndex.
